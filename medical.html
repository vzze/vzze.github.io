                    There has been a lot of hype around the applications of machine learning in medicine.
                    But how is machine learning actually helping bench-to-bedside scientists and clinicians do their
                    jobs?

                    <hr>

                    The idea of improving medicine with computation is almost as old as digital computers.
                    In the early 1960s, scientists used a computer in diagnosing blood diseases, and that was
                    just one pioneering example in this field. In the branch of artificial intelligence (AI)
                    called ‘machine learning’, computer software learns from experience.
                    The results teach medical researchers and clinicians new ways of studying diseases,
                    making medicines and treating patients.

                    <hr>

                    Computation in general enhances several key areas of clinical research, and AI-based methods
                    promise even more applications for researchers. Despite not being in wide use so far,
                    machine-learning systems already influence several areas of clinical research, such as
                    appreciating the value of big data.

                    Combining machine learning with multi-modal datasets and almost unlimited computing power
                    allows clinical researchers to “reconstruct the underlying mechanisms of disease,” says Colin Hill,
                    CEO and cofounder of GNS Healthcare. For example, GNS Healthcare’s AI-driven simulation platform
                    Gemini provides a computer model of the progression of multiple myeloma and drug responses.
                    This model “harnesses the power of causal machine learning and simulation and in-depth clinical
                    and molecular patient data to allow pharma companies to simulate drug response at the individual
                    patient level,” Hill explains.

                    <p class="card-text">
                    In any medical research, predicting the outcome for a particular scenario proves very difficult.
                    “With partial or imperfect biological knowledge, statistical models are the best way to reveal
                    structure
                    and predict outcomes,” says David Watson, doctoral candidate at the Oxford Internet Institute of the
                    University of Oxford and founding member of the Digital Ethics Lab. “It is not always obvious how to
                    do
                    this with clinical data alone, and although clinicians are often confident that genomic information
                    can
                    solve the problem, this data is so noisy that it may make the task harder rather than simpler.” By
                    combining information from clinicians and data-science tools, including machine learning, scientists
                    can
                    develop a hypothesis, model it, adjust it, and replicate the process in an iterative manner.
                    “This requires close collaboration between clinicians and data scientists, who tend to conceptualize
                    problems
                    rather differently, but getting people with different realms of expertise to work together on
                    challenging
                    problems is what good research is all about,” Watson says.

                    In the clinic, machine learning offers great promise, but much work lies ahead. As Keane says,
                    “There is a huge gap between showing a proof of concept in a research paper and actually deploying
                    a machine learning system in the real world — something that Eric Topol of Scripps Research and I have
                    described as ‘the AI chasm’.” He adds, “There is undoubtedly huge potential for machine learning to
                    transform healthcare, but going ‘from code to clinic’ is the hard part.”

                    <p class="card-text">
                    From military applications to medicine, computation can be used to analyze images.
                    Imaging and clinical experts Dineo Mpanya and Nqoba Tsabedze of the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg
                    Academic Hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa, teamed up to describe the impact of machine
                    learning
                    on the interpretation of medical images, such as chest X-rays. Subtypes of machine learning,
                    such as convolutional neural networks, “can identify subtle changes in chest X-ray films, and in
                    some
                    instances, the accuracy levels for diagnosing conditions, such as pneumonia, are equivalent or
                    superior
                    to that of clinicians,” the scientists note. “Unlike traditional statistical methods, where
                    inferences
                    are made based on the population studied, machine-learning algorithms mimic human cognitive
                    processes
                    when making decisions.”

                    <hr>

                    In April 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first AI-based diagnostic, IDx-DR,
                    which
                    detects diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetes by analyzing retinal images. Machine learning
                    will
                    soon be applied to many other medical conditions, from cardiology to neurodegenerative diseases and
                    beyond.

                    <p class="card-text">
                    In addition to using it to diagnose conditions, clinicians can use machine learning to predict a
                    patient’s
                    prognosis. The first application that comes to mind here is usually cancer. For example, one
                    international
                    team of scientists developed a machine learning–based tool that analyzes the prognosis of patients
                    with stage
                    III colon cancer, and the group reported that the results “could provide crucial information to aid
                    treatment
                    planning” for people with this disease. Plus, John Halamka, president of the Mayo Clinic Platform,
                    and his
                    colleagues suggested that machine learning might improve a clinician’s ability to determine the
                    likely
                    outcome of a patient with COVID-19. As with the use of machine language in clinical diagnosis, work
                    in
                    prognosis promises many improvements ahead.
